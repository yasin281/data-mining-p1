Customer Age:

We can see through the histogram and summary that the customer age roughly starts at the age of 17 and ends at 80, which is the logical age spectrum expected for the products we are analizing. Moreover, we can observe that it is skewed towards the left (17-49) rather than the right (50-80), suggesting a bias for younger customers. This is backed up by the fact that the peak is around 30 years, which can also be seen by the mean of 35.88 and median of 34. Although the graph is vaguely shaped like a bell curve, through the Shapiro Test for normality and the Q-Q plot we can safely conclude that the distribution for the customer age is not normal, which implies that there are no outliers in the data for customer age. Furthermore, even if we were to apply a logarithmic transformation, we would still arrive at the same conclusion, as seen by the graphs and test after the logarithmic transformation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customer Gender:

We can see through the barplot and frequency table that the gender distribution follows closely a 50/50 split, save for some deviation inherent to the sample.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Month:

We can see though the barplot and frequency table that the month distribution is relatively stable from January to April and from August to November, which corresponds to late winter and early spring and late summer and autumn respectively. Moreover, we can observe two peaks at May-June and December. All in all, we can safely conclude that sales do not experience massive fluctuations due to seasonality.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Year:

It is pretty clear through the barplot and frequency table that the year distribution is uniform since we are working with a subdataset that contains roughly the same amount of samples per year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Country:

It can be seen evidently enough through the pie chart and barplot that the United States is the number one consumer, followed by Australia and the rest. Although not as obvious in the pie chart, since Canada, France, the UK and Germany are pretty close to one another, the barplot and frequency table are overall better for determining the order the countries based on number of purchases. A curious finding is the existance of a single entry for Portugal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Category:

It can be seen that the accessories make up most of the sales, around 60% according to the pie chart, while bikes and clothing combined form the remaining 40%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Order Quantity:

It can be seen from the histogram that the distribution of order quantity does not follow a normal distribution. In fact, it heavily spikes at 1-2 and then it stays consistent until 30 where it finally falls off. Through the boxplot we also arrive at the conclusion that the distribution is rather bottom heavy with an average strongly brought down by the spike at 1-2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unit Cost:

It can be seen through the histogram that most of the products have a unit cost below 500. In fact, the peak is so acute that it makes it difficult to evaluate the other costs, since, relatively speaking, they are much more similar to one another. To solve this issue, we can apply a logarithmic transformation to the data. As expected, the peak at low costs is still present, but not as overwhelming anymore. As such, we can see that there is a valley right before e^2, followed by a second peak. This pattern can also be seen, although with much more pronounced valley at e^5. Through the boxplot of the logarithm we observe that most of the costs, accumulate at the lower values.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unit Price:

It can be seen through the histogram that most of the products have a unit price below 500. In fact, the peak is so acute that it obscures the details for the other prices, since, relatively speaking, they are much more similar to one another. To combat this issue, we can apply a logarithmic transformation to the data. As expected, the peak at low prices is still present, but we can see that it has shifted slightly to the right, suggesting that there is a distinction between cheapest products and cheap products so to speak. Other interesting details include the peak at e^4, which corresponds to the mid-low prices, which is followed by a valley before finally arriving at the peak at e^8 which are the high-end prices. As indicated by the boxplot of the logarithm, we observe that most prices accumulate at the lower values.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Size:

It can be seen through the pie chart that the sizes have roughly an equal split of 25% each.









---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance:

The barplot suggests a relatively balanced distribution across the two categories (Basic and Premium), with Premium possibly having a slight edge, though not overwhelmingly. 
On the other hand, in the pie chart, we can see that there are missing values ("not categorized"), revealing that there is a third category representing "None" insurance option.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Color:

The pie chart and barplot includes five colors (Black, White, Red, Green and Blue), all in comparable proportions. There is no clear, overwhelmingly popular color choice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warranty:

Both, the pie chart and barplot for Warranty shows four categories (1 Year, 2 Years, 3 Years and Lifetime) split fairly evenly. No single warranty duration appears to dominate the others significantly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eco_Friendly:

The pie chart and barplot shows an almost even split between True and False, indicating that approximately half of the items or orders are labeled as eco-friendly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shipping_Cost:

Values range roughly from 0 to 100, and the histogram shows a broad distribution with moderate peaks; no single cost range stands out as dominant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Discount:

There is a pronounced spike at 0 (indicating no discount), with the rest of the values spread from about 5 to 30. Higher discounts close to 30 are relatively less common.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shipping_Weight:

This variable spans from 0 to about 15. The histogram suggests two slight peaks around 5â€“6 kg and around 10-11 kg, indicating two principal shipping weight ranges within the data. In addition, weights under 1kgs are less common.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Delivery_time:

The histogram ranges roughly from 1 to 9 days, with frequencies that are fairly uniform. It seems like a slight peak at 1-2 days.
